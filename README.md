## 📖 Abstract

This research introduces a novel optimal execution framework that integrates Hawkes processes with linear-quadratic (LQ) stochastic control to model self-exciting order flow in financial markets. The methodology captures clustering effects in market microstructure and provides tractable solutions for optimal execution under realistic market conditions.

## 🎯 Key Contributions

- **Novel Framework**: First integration of Hawkes processes with LQ control for optimal execution
- **Empirical Validation**: Parameters calibrated on real market data from 5 major stocks
- **Performance Improvement**: 8-15% cost reduction compared to traditional execution strategies
- **Complete Implementation**: Fully reproducible codebase with comprehensive documentation

## 📊 Experimental Results

| Metric | Result |
|--------|---------|
| Cost Reduction vs AC | 8-15% |
| Market Regimes Tested | 3×3 parameter grid |
| Real Data Validation | 5 stocks, 1,255 trading days |
| Statistical Significance | p < 0.05 across tested scenarios |
